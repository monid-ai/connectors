/**
 * HOOKS output.fromResponse + output.fromError — the two presentation
 * projections, sharing ONE contract shape (envelope in, Json out; returns
 * FN_CONTRACT-validated — the "transform must guarantee JSON" rule):
 *
 *   - `fromResponse`: consolidated SUCCESS response → the user-facing
 *     output (CSV → rows, reshaping).
 *   - `fromError`: vendor PROVIDER-ERROR envelope → a digestible error
 *     shape (design D12 — v1's per-call-site `apifyErrorBody` normalization
 *     as ONE hook). Runs ONLY on provider-error results, AFTER zero-usage
 *     forcing (structurally cannot touch a bill); absent ⇒ the raw body
 *     passes through. Convention: keep the raw body under a `raw` key —
 *     digest, never hide. `output.schema` applies to fromResponse output
 *     only (success shape), never to error projections.
 *
 * The envelope data shape is shared with usage.consolidate.

/** ctx.data for post-response hooks — the validated input + decoded output.
 *  `state` is present only for lifecycle (async) runs: the final threaded
 *  state, so settle fns can read billing signals stashed during polling
 *  (e.g. Apify's pricing fields ride the poll response, not the dataset).
 *  `model` is the DOC'S OWN usage.model (REQUIRED on every doc): a GENERIC
 *  provider consolidate keys its `usage.counts` by looking the component
 *  id up here — leaf → the unit, composite → the sole PER_UNIT component
 *  (single-valued by the loader's ≥2-metered rule) — with zero per-doc
 *  code (design D19). */

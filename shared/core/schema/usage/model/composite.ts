 * rate card prices one row per component and sums. The map REPLACES the
 * old anonymous array — id uniqueness is structural, and the old
 * constraints (≤1 PER_CALL, distinct PER_UNIT units) are gone with it:
 * they existed only because (kind, unit) was the implicit key, and they
 * forbade the models vendors actually publish (tiktok-comments' two flat
 * events; linkedin's two same-unit profile rates). Components are SCALARS
 * only — no nesting: conditional lines, offsets and input-selected rates
 * are COUNTING rules owned by consolidate/estimate, never model shapes

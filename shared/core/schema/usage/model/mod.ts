/**
 * usage.model — the RATE-FREE billing-shape ALGEBRA: WHAT an endpoint's
 * consumption looks like, never what it costs (rates live in the hosted
 * rate card, keyed by endpoint + OUR account tier — verified necessary:
 * apify event prices are tiered by subscription plan). Two operators
 * (designs D18 + D19):
 *
 *   - LEAF:      FREE (never bills — design D25), PER_CALL (flat — the
 *                run is the product, billed 1 iff success) and PER_UNIT
 *                (metered — billed per N of `unit`).
 *   - AND:       COMPOSITE — the sum of scalar components, KEYED BY
 *                COMPONENT ID (flat start fee AND per-item metering).
 *                FREE is never a component (a free component is an
 *                omitted component).
 *
 * Grammar, closed and total: "a simple charge, or a keyed sum of simple
 * charges". Deliberately absent — every v1 price type maps in WITHOUT a
 * new kind, because FNS OWN ALL CONDITIONS (design D19):
 *   - TIERED ("default + gated add-on lines, SUMMED"): a gated line is a
 *     composite component whose count is 0 when the feature is off — the
 *     `when` gate becomes counting logic, not a model shape.
 *   - PER_UNIT_MATRIX / VARIANT ("input options pick ONE cell"): a
 *     select-one is a composite whose fn populates ONLY the selected key
 *     (linkedin's profileScraperMode). The VARIANT kind is deleted.
 *   - volume schedules ("first 1k tokens at X"): a shape of the services
 *     CARD ROW; base-covers-first-N (exa) is a composite with an OFFSET
 *     counting rule (counts["additional_result"] = max(0, n − 10)).

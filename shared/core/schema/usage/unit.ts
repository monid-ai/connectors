 * PER_CALL model KIND, fully described by the model + the run's success
 * flag — it needs no count, so giving it one was a second spelling of
 * the same fact (design D18).
 *
 * UPPERCASE canonical values (the repo enum rule: uppercase keys AND
 * values for every closed vocabulary); lowercase rendering is a DISPLAY
 * concern (web/CLI label maps). Provider-NATIVE truth only (uniform
 * pricing is the hosted rate card's job). Append-only: extending requires
 * an engine minor bump.

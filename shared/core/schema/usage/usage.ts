 *   1. `credits`  — how many credits consumed, per declared credit
 *      system: the priced vector (broker: credits[id] × card row).
 *      When the vendor reports its OWN meter (`usage.consolidate`),
 *      that claim IS this number — source of truth; otherwise it is
 *      the engine's fold of evidence through the doc's rate card.
 *   2. `evidence` — WHY: one entry per rate-card line (units consumed
 *      for PER_UNIT lines, 1 for PER_CALL lines — engine-appended).
 *      Anyone holding the DOC re-derives the fold from evidence × the
 *      model's every/amount: the bill is checkable from public facts.
 * Plus ONE signal, present only when the two calculations disagree
 * (design D27): `mismatch.derived` carries OUR fold when the vendor's
 * claim (already in `credits`) differs — "vendor says X, we compute Y"
 * — surfaced, never hidden, never failing the run. Same interface
 * otherwise; only how `credits` was calculated differs.
